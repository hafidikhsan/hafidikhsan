## About Me 🔥

**💫 Fresh graduate Computer Engineering Bachelor's Degree with a passion for software engineering**

After graduating from Telkom University in Bandung with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, I am deeply passionate about mobile development using SwiftUI and Flutter and also web development using React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. During my academic journey, I participated in a Certified Independent Study program sponsored by the Indonesian government through Dicoding Indonesia as a multi-platform and back-end developer. Over the past three years, I have been transforming UI designs into functional programs. In the last year, I also ventured into machine learning, specifically focusing on speech and text processing using TensorFlow and Transformers for my final Capstone Project.

In addition to my primary interests, I also have a keen passion for tech, design, finance, and science. I am an enthusiast of music, movies, and sports, particularly football and Formula 1. I am confident in my capacity to swiftly learn and adapt to new technologies and environments. I eagerly embrace new challenges and consistently aim to be the best version of myself.
